"""Turn a prompt into a contract, once, offline.

This is the only part of the verifier that talks to a model, and it runs before
verification rather than during it. The contracts land on disk and freeze there,
so a score is reproducible next year, auditable by anyone who opens the JSON, and
costs nothing to recompute.

The model translates; it never scores. It is asked for requirements and quotes,
not for judgements, and every explicit requirement is checked against the prompt
text before the contract is accepted.

Gemini by default, deliberately: 587 of the 607 annotated assets were generated
by OpenAI models, so extracting their requirements with an OpenAI model risks
reproducing the same misreading that produced the asset. Correlated errors would
hide exactly the failures this is meant to find.

The key is read from the environment or a ``.env`` file and sent in a header --
never in the URL, where it would end up in logs.

INSTRUCTION = """\
You read a text description of an articulated 3D object and write down what the \
description requires. You do not design, judge, or score anything.

Return JSON only, with this shape:

{
  "expected_parts": [
    {"name": "...", "count": 4, "source": "explicit", "confidence": 1.0, "quote": "..."}
  ],
  "expected_joints": [
    {"child": "...", "parent": "...", "kind": "revolute", "axis_hint": "...",
     "location_hint": "...", "count": 4, "source": "explicit", "confidence": 1.0, "quote": "..."}
  ]
}

Rules:

1. `quote` must be copied VERBATIM from the description -- an exact substring, not \
a paraphrase. A requirement whose quote is not found in the description is thrown away.
2. `source` is "explicit" when the description says it, with the quote. Use "prior" \
for a part that any real object of this kind must have and must move even though the \
description never says so -- a quad bike has wheels that roll and a suspension that \
travels; a microscope has a stage that moves. Give priors confidence at most 0.7 and \
an empty quote. Be strict about what earns a prior: the object would not work as the \
thing it is named without it. Do not add decoration, fasteners, or cosmetic parts.
3. `child` is the part that moves. `parent` is what it moves against -- the hinge \
plate, the column, the chute, the post. Name both the way the description names \
them. If the description does not say what it attaches to, leave `parent` empty \
rather than guessing.
4. `kind` is one of:
   - "revolute": rotation with a stop -- a hinge, a lid, a door, a tilting head
   - "continuous": rotation without end -- a wheel, a rotor, a spinning blade
   - "prismatic": sliding or pushing along a line -- a drawer, a button, a carriage
   - "fixed": explicitly rigid
   Use null if the description does not say.
5. `count` only when the description gives a number. Otherwise null -- null means \
unspecified, not one.
6. `axis_hint` and `location_hint` are short phrases from the description about \
direction ("vertical", "about its axle") and placement ("at the panel edges", \
"rear"). Empty string when absent.
7. Do not invent parts. Do not describe geometry, quality, or correctness.
