"""How per-joint scores become one asset score, per item: ``worst`` or ``mean``.

The protocol gives per-joint formulas and never says how to combine them, and
the choice decides more than the formulas do. Under ``mean`` with tau at 0.70 an
asset must break more than 30% of its joints before the average falls far
enough, so one wrong hinge among four is a pass.

Measured both ways, against injected faults whose answer is known and against
the human labels. Injection prefers ``worst`` on every item and not narrowly:
B7 31% to 47%, B8 32% to 63%, B9 7% to 97%, B10 12% to 34%. Human labels agree
on B8 (F1 0.40 to 0.56) and B10 (0 to 0.67); on B7 they cannot adjudicate, with
six positives and kappa below chance either way.

B9 is the one that looks like a loss and is not. Under ``mean`` it scores kappa
0.000 by never predicting failure at all -- silence, not agreement. Under
``worst`` it answers, catches 97% of injected type errors, and disagrees with
the human labels. That disagreement is a result rather than a defect: six
records in the annotated set declare exactly the type the prompt asked for and
were failed anyway, because the annotators were watching a mesh move rather than
reading a type string. Tuning the detector to agree with a label that measures
something else would only hide that.

An earlier reading of this table said mean for B7 and B9. It was taken before
the matcher was fixed, when a requirement could be answered by a sibling's part,
and it did not survive the fix. Revisit it again on a dev set that is not 31
already-failing records.

    origin, so the distance that matters is from the joint to the link it moves,

    all of them, and it measures the thing the item is about: a hinge sitting
    outside the door it swings is not attached to it. Deviation from ``D``,
    recorded.

    **Axis.** Compared against the direction the prompt named -- "a vertical side
    hinge", "horizontal hinges at the panel edges". Only direction words that
    resolve in the world frame are used; "about its axle" and "coaxial" name a
    direction relative to geometry we do not have, and are left uncomputed.

    quantity as B9's classifier against a declared graph, and is omitted.
