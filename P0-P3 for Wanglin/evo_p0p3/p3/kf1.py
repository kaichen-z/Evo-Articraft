"""KF1 -- articulation specification fidelity.

Does the model implement the motion chain and joint configuration P0 froze? Each predicate
lands together with the gold-standard asset that makes it fail. That pairing is not
ceremony: a predicate no input can fail passes everything, and against a corpus of
mostly-correct assets that is indistinguishable from a corpus of correct assets. This
project has been caught by exactly that twice -- a fault injection displacing a joint
origin by a whole link diagonal detected nothing, because the origin IS the child frame
origin and moving it carries the geometry along.

Two of the specification's four KF1 bullets could not be implemented as written, and both
failures were of that kind. "A slide introduces no extra rotation" is true of every MuJoCo
slide by construction; "a hinge anchor remains fixed under a small perturbation" is true of
every hinge, because mj_kinematics derives the anchor from the declared jnt_pos. Neither
admits a failing model. What replaces them is :func:`dof_composition` and :func:`anchor`,
which compare the model against something outside itself.
