"""Materialising the gold-standard assets from one correct file plus a list of edits.

A predicate cannot be argued into correctness. It can only be shown to fire on an input
whose answer is known, and to stay quiet on one that is right -- and the only inputs whose
answers are known are the ones we broke ourselves. Real assets do not come with their true
anchor quality recorded anywhere, and the specific disease this project keeps catching --
a predicate no model can fail -- is invisible against them, because a tautology passing
everything looks exactly like a corpus of good assets.

So each defect is stored as the smallest textual edit that breaks the correct file, and
the substitution is required to actually change the compiled model. An edit that silently
matches nothing would leave a "counterexample" identical to the control, and the predicate
tested against it would look sound while checking nothing.
