"""Loading an Articraft asset into MuJoCo, and being honest about what we changed.

Articraft ships ``model.urdf`` plus OBJ meshes under
``cache/record_materialization/<record_id>/``. Two things about those files decide the
whole shape of P3, and both were measured across all 546 materialised assets rather than
assumed:

**No asset has a ``<collision>`` element.** Every geom therefore compiles with
``contype = conaffinity = 0``, MuJoCo's broad phase skips all of them, and ``mjData.ncon``
is always zero. Contact-based collision detection is not merely awkward here, it returns
nothing at all. Every distance in P3 goes through :func:`mujoco.mj_geomDistance`, which
ignores ``contype``/``conaffinity`` and the parent-child filter alike. That last part is
not a workaround but the correct behaviour: MuJoCo disables collision between a parent and
child joined by a joint, which is exactly the pair -- door against its own frame, drawer
against its own carcass -- that a swept-interference check most needs to see.

**Only 205 of 546 declare ``<inertial>``.** MuJoCo refuses to compile a moving body with
no mass, so the rest need one synthesised. That value is ours, not the asset's, and
:attr:`LoadedAsset.inertia_synthesized` records it so no score can ever be built on it.
P3's scope excludes mass, friction, damping and actuation anyway; the synthetic inertia
exists only to get past the compiler. Whether an asset's *real* inertial properties are
valid is Gate G3's question, and 341 of these assets will genuinely fail it.

With that recipe, 545 of the 546 load. The remaining one has a link whose declared inertia
is itself degenerate.

*everything* -- they contain no other geometry. Without this flag the model compiles to
zero geoms and every geometric predicate silently has nothing to measure.
