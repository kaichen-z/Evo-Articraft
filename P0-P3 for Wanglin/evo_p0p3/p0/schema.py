"""The frozen prompt contract.

P0 is authored before the asset exists and is never edited afterwards. Everything here
is immutable on purpose: a contract that can be revised after seeing a candidate asset
is not a contract, it is a rationalisation.

Two design rules run through the whole schema and explain most of its shape.

**Every name must resolve to geometry.** The previous attempt at these metrics matched
prose part names against code identifiers and drowned: of 70 flagged failures 63 were
false alarms, 42 of those from "part not found" -- but 4 of the 7 true positives came
from that same flag. Signal and noise were the same event, and a paired bootstrap showed
no better matcher could separate them. So here, every identifier used anywhere must be
declared in ``required_parts`` or ``joints`` (rule A1), and instances are enumerated
rather than expanded from a count. A "part not found" then has exactly one meaning.

**Prefer relations over coordinates.** A URDF has no semantic orientation -- only numbers.
Two identical cabinets authored ninety degrees apart are the same object with different
files. Requiring generators to author in a canonical frame would turn a convention
violation into a kinematics failure, which across several generators measures who read
the frame documentation rather than whose joints are right. So an axis may be stated
semantically (resolved against gravity, which is free), relationally (resolved from the
geometry of two named parts, which follows the asset wherever it is placed), or numerically
(only when ``canonical_frame.front`` is anchored, and reported N/A otherwise).
