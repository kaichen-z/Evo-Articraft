"""KF2, judged by a gearbox whose coupling we broke three different ways.

The asset that matters most here is ``gearbox_missing_coupling``: geometrically perfect
gears with nothing linking them. The specification's printed formula scores it a perfect
one -- no constraint means no residual, and a maximum over an empty set satisfies any
tolerance -- so the single most severe coupling failure takes full marks. The ``bound()``
factor exists for that asset, and this file is where it is held to it.
