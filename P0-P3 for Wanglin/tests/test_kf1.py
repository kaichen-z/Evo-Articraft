"""KF1, judged entirely by assets whose answers we built in.

The manifest carries a full verdict for every predicate on every defective asset -- 70
expectations across eight assets -- and this file asserts the whole matrix. Stating only
the verdict a defect is *aimed* at would leave the interesting half unchecked: whether the
other eight predicates stayed quiet. A check that fires on everything broken has not
diagnosed a wrong parent, it has noticed that something is different, and a report built
on it cannot tell anyone what to fix.

Two defects legitimately break two claims each, and the manifest says so rather than
massaging the assets until each breaks exactly one. A revolute turned prismatic changes
the unit its range is measured in; a hinge axis turned horizontal stops running along any
edge. Forcing isolation there would mean authoring absurd assets to flatter the tests.
